# Architecture

## System Components

Our system comprises several key components that work together to deliver a seamless and powerful experience:

- **Generative AI Engine**: The core engine that powers our real-time AI models.
- **LCM Module**: Integrates with the AI engine to enable swift inference with minimal steps.
- **dePIN Network**: Facilitates secure and private data transactions.

## Workflow

1. **Data Input**: Users input data into the system via a user-friendly interface.
2. **Data Processing**: The LCM module processes the data, utilizing the guided reverse diffusion process to predict the PF-ODE solution.
3. **Real-Time Output**: The processed data generates immediate outputs, which are securely transmitted through the dePIN network.
4. **User Feedback**: Users receive real-time results and can provide feedback to further improve model accuracy.

## Implementation Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Follow the installation guide to set up the platform on your local or cloud environment.
2. **Configuration**: Customize the settings to match your specific use case and data requirements.
3. **Integration**: Connect the platform with your existing data sources and systems.

### API Reference

Our platform provides a robust API that allows developers to integrate and interact with our system programmatically. Detailed documentation on API endpoints, request formats, and response structures is available in the API Reference section.

### Tutorials and Examples

To help you get the most out of our platform, we offer a series of tutorials and examples that demonstrate common use cases and best practices. These resources are designed to guide you through the process of setting up, configuring, and utilizing our generative AI models and dePIN network.
