# $TMPAI Tokenomics

## Distribution

The total supply of our native token, $TMPAI, is set at 1,000,000 units. This allocation is strategically divided to support liquidity, marketing, and ongoing development, ensuring a balanced approach that promotes long-term sustainability and growth.

- **Liquidity Pool:** A significant portion, 65% of the total supply, is allocated to the liquidity pool. This substantial investment in liquidity ensures smooth and stable market operations, facilitating easy trading and price stability.
- **Marketing:** To effectively promote the blockchain and increase adoption, 10% of the total supply is dedicated to marketing efforts. This will cover everything from advertising campaigns to community engagement and partnership initiatives.
- **Team & Development:** 5% is reserved for the team and ongoing development projects. This allocation is crucial for funding continuous improvements and innovations, as well as rewarding the team responsible for the platform's success.
- **Staking:** The remaining 20% is reserved for the staking system.

## Tax

To sustain the blockchain's operations through its critical phases of testing and production, a tax mechanism is in place on all buy and sell transactions. Each transaction will incur a 5% tax, which serves several essential functions:

- **Revenue Generation:** This tax is a vital source of recurring revenue, necessary to cover the high operational costs associated with maintaining a blockchain infrastructure.
- **Economic Stability:** By collecting this tax, the blockchain ensures it has the financial resources needed to remain robust and functional, regardless of external economic conditions.
- **Support for Development:** The funds collected through this tax will also support ongoing development efforts, allowing for continuous enhancement of the platform's features and security measures.

Our tokenomics model is designed with the dual goals of promoting robust economic health and supporting strategic growth initiatives. By carefully balancing the distribution of tokens and implementing a thoughtful tax strategy, we are poised to build a resilient and thriving ecosystem. This approach ensures that our blockchain not only meets the current needs of our users but is also well-equipped to adapt to future challenges and opportunities.
